redesigning using Shopify Storefront API. 

New website link -> https://myhealthyfamily.vercel.app/

Existing website for reference -> https://myhealthy.family/

Build a website entirely from scratch. All the design and functionalities are coded from scratch using React for component lifecycle, React-Spring for animation, and Material UI for common components.  
Storefront API allows multiple websites to run parallel with the original Shopify website, therefore, has the advantage of not distributing the existing service. Moreover, once a customer is ready to proceed with checkout the items in their cart are sent to the original Shopify store as objects and will use the original Shopify stores' checkout implementation, thus reducing the errors that can occur during the payment.
 
This website acts as a Shopify theme where any Shopify store when the API key is provided will look like this store, will have the same design, and will be able to use all the functionalities.
